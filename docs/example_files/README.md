These are examples demonstrating planned structure for configuration, log, and state storage files.
They have been written by hand to represent a vision for future implementation.
The format of these files is subject to sudden change and may not align perfectly with the actual implementation.

* `./input/*` files are human-editable configuration files.
* `./internal/*` files are used by backdat to maintain state internally and are generally only useful to view if debugging.
* `./output/*` files are potentially useful for reading by external users/programs.
* Files in `./future` have not yet been implemented in any way.

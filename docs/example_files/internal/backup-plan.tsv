# /var/opt/backdat/backup-plan
#
# The generated backup plan file defines the tentative backup plan from given settings, files, and remotes.
# This plan will change after each backup as more information is aquired about the current state of backups and the remotes.
# This file resembles the backup log.
#
# This is a global file that must be synced across all hosts so that the plan can be modified.
#
# Entries are cronological.
#
# Only advanced users will be reading this file.
